        I specialize in disability studies, adulthood emergence, and applied data analytics, combining sociological theory with advanced quantitative methods to address health and social inequities. My work bridges research and practice using R and Python for data wrangling, visualization, and reproducible workflows. I am passionate about translating complex demographic and health data into actionable insights for policy and practice. My goal is to leverage these skills to contribute to evidence-based policy and innovative solutions that address health and social inequities, particularly for populations navigating disability and transitions to adulthood. **Specialties:** Analytics & Data, Leadership, Programming, Strategic Planning, Writing & Editing
